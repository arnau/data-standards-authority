The Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) is the unique identifier conforming to [BS7666-2] for every addressable location in Great Britain.

UPRNs provide every property or object with a consistent identifier throughout its lifecycle, from planning through to demolition.

A UPRN consists of a set of digits (0-9) of up to 12 digits in length.
