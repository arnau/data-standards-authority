The Unique Street Reference Number (USRN) was created by the Ordnance Survey (OS). It consists of numbers of up to 12 digits in length. Local governments in the UK have allocated a unique number for each street in Great Britain.

The USRN identifiers, along with their associated grid references, are available as open data under Open Government License (OGL) from the Ordnance Survey Data Hub. Further information, such as address or building classifications are available from Ordnance Survey products under the Public Sector Geospatial Agreement.
